A Little tool for generating Identicons in Java and Groovy

Docs comming shortly!


### TODOs
* Reactor the Pattern Enum into a base class. Including closures in an enum was pretty amuzing but this woudl benifit from a default class that can be overriden and allow for more patterns to be created without messing with an enum thats getting kinda ugly/
* Allow for icon size changes, default is currently 100x100
* Enable seed byt name or random
